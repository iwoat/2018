            <div id="5" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                The rational homotopy theory of Quillen and Sullivan identifies homotopy types of topological spaces with differential
                graded commutative (co)algebras, and with differential graded Lie algebras, after inverting primes.  Given any
                non-negative integer n, we can instead invert certain "v<sub>n</sub>-self maps" and seek algebraic models for the
                resulting unstable "v<sub>n</sub>-periodic" homotopy types.  I'll explain why this is a natural and useful
                generalization of the classical story, and how a version of it has been achieved through Goodwillie calculus in recent
                work of Behrens and Rezk.  I'll then explain my work on its applications to calculating unstable homotopy types in the
                case of n = 2.  A key tool is power operations in Morava E-theory.  Time permitting, I'll report further joint work in

            <div id="6" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Chromatic localization can be seen as a way to calculate a particular infinite piece of the homotopy of a spectrum.  
                For example, the (infinite) chromatic localization of a p-local sphere is its rationalization, and recovers only the
                zero stem in œÄ<sub>&lowast;</sub>ùïä.  Palmieri has developed an analogue of chromatic homotopy theory in an algebraic
                category Stable(A), which gives information about Adams E<sub>2</sub>-pages.  Unlike in stable homotopy, in this world
                there are many non-nilpotent operators acting on the unit object, and unlike localization at p, localizing at some of
                these operators can provide nontrivial information.  We discuss one of these localizations, which recovers partial
                information about the height 2 part of the Adams E<sub>2</sub>-page for the sphere.

            <div id="7" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                This talk concerns a twenty-thousand-year old mistake: The natural numbers record only the result of counting and not
                the process of counting.  As algebra is rooted in the natural numbers, the higher algebra of Joyal and Lurie is rooted
                in a more basic notion of number which also records the process of counting.  Long advocated by Waldhausen, the
                arithmetic of these more basic numbers should eliminate denominators.  Notable manifestations of this vision include the
                B√∂kstedt-Hsiang-Madsen topological cyclic homology, which receives a denominator-free Chern character, and the related
                Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze integral p-adic Hodge theory, which makes it possible to exploit torsion cohomology classes in
                arithmetic geometry.  Moreover, for schemes smooth and proper over a finite field, the analogue of de Rham cohomology in
                this setting naturally gives rise to a cohomological interpretation of the Hasse-Weil zeta function by regularized
                determinants, as envisioned by Deninger.

                product of MString and the "small" spectrum T<sub>2</sub> splits into copies of Morava E-theories.  Here, T<sub>2</sub>

            <div id="9" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Motivic homotopy theory is the homotopy theory for smooth schemes.  The application of motivic homotopy theory to
                algebraic geometry is a success, solving important problems such as the Milnor conjecture and the Bloch-Kato
                conjecture.<br />
  
                On the other hand, the Betti realization functor relates motivic homotopy theory to classical homotopy theory.  This
                produces powerful methods for studying classical homotopy theory, such as Isaksen's computations of stable homotopy
                groups of spheres up to stem 59.<br />

                In this talk, I will present joint work with Gheorghe, Isaksen and Xu on the latter direction.  We will show that the
                category of cellular CœÑ-modules over the complex numbers is equivalent to the derived category of BP<sub>&lowast;</sub>BP-comodules
                as infinity categories.  This implies that the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence is isomorphic to the motivic Adams
                spectral sequence for CœÑ, providing a systematic way to generate nontrivial Adams differentials using algebraic
                computations.  Using this method, we can do the computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres up to the 90-stem,
                and many new phenomena in stable homotopy groups are discovered in this new range.

                extend the definition of a classical James-Hopf invariant to a simplicial group setting.  This allows us to realize
                certain coalgebra idempotents at simplicial set level and obtain a functorial decomposition of the spectral sequence,
                associated with the lower p-central series filtration on the free simplicial group.<br />
                The talk will aim to general audience, starting from the introduction of basic notions and techniques on the topic.

                It is a classical result that if G is an appropriate Lie group, then its loop space Œ©G is homotopy equivalent to a
                certain infinite-dimensional manifold (homogeneous space) called the Grassmannian model.  In (for example) geometric
                representation theory, there is a well-studied algebro-geometric analogue of the Grassmannian model, the so-called
                affine Grassmannian Gr<sub>G</sub> of an algebraic group G.  This is an ind-variety.  We show that there is a canonical
                ùî∏<sup>1</sup>-equivalence between Gr<sub>G</sub> and the space of ùîæ<sub>m</sub>-loops Œ©<sub>ùîæ<sub>m</sub></sub>G on G,
                in the sense of ùî∏<sup>1</sup>-homotopy theory.

            <div id="18" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Elliptic cohomology is a natural big brother to ordinary cohomology and K-theory.  However, in contrast to the geometric
                objects that provide representatives for ordinary cohomology and K-theory classes, there is no such geometric
                description of elliptic cohomology.  This talk will explain some recent progress, namely a geometric model for
                equivariant elliptic cohomology over the complex numbers.  The construction is motivated by techniques in
                supersymmetric gauge theory.  This is joint work with Arnav Tripathy.

                Spectra can be considered as the universal presentable stable ‚àû-category, similarly Sets can be considered as the

                More generally some properties of presentable ‚àû-categories can be classified as equivalent to being a module over a
                universal symmetric monoidal ‚àû-category.  We call such universal symmetric monoidal ‚àû-category "modes."  We describe
                certain facts about the general theory of modes and present how we can generate new ones from old ones.

            <div id="20" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                The space of rational maps, as defined by Gaitsgory, is the fiber of an approximation map from the factorizable version
                of the affine Grassmannian to the space of G-bundles on a curve.  Gaitsgory and Gaitsgory-Lurie proved that the space of
                rational maps from a curve to a quasi-affine variety has acyclic etale homology.  I will explain a proof of this 
                statement that enhances the acyclicity on homology to contractibility in the sense of motivic homotopy theory.  The
                proof uses a moving lemma of Suslin.
